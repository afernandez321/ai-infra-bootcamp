# � AI Infrastructure Bootcamp

This repository documents my **6-month journey** to become an **AI Infrastructure Engineer**, combining my background in Linux/DevOps with hands-on projects in **HPC, distributed systems, GPU optimization, and MLOps**.  

The repo includes:
- � Daily Markdown notes (`notes/`)
- �️ Practice scripts (`scripts/`)
- � Monthly projects & capstones (`projects/`)

---

## � Goal

To build the skills and portfolio required for roles like **AI Infrastructure Engineer / AI Systems Engineer**, focusing on:

- Designing and running **scalable AI/ML infrastructure**
- Managing **HPC clusters, GPUs, and distributed systems**
- Optimizing model **deployment and inference**
- Applying **MLOps, CI/CD, and automation** to AI workflows
- Ensuring **security, monitoring, and compliance** in production AI systems

## � Roadmap (6 Months)

### Month 1 – Foundations of AI Infrastructure
- Linux performance tuning (cgroups, NUMA, GPU drivers)
- GPU basics (CUDA, monitoring, PyTorch GPU vs CPU)
- HPC networking (InfiniBand, RoCEv2, RDMA basics)
- Containers for GPU workloads (Docker + NVIDIA toolkit)

### Month 2 – Distributed Systems & HPC
- SLURM job scheduling
- PyTorch DistributedDataParallel (DDP)
- Horovod & DeepSpeed
- Kubernetes for AI workloads (Kubeflow basics)

### Month 3 – Model Deployment & Optimization
- Model conversion (ONNX)
- Inference acceleration (TensorRT, OpenVINO)
- Triton / TorchServe / TensorFlow Serving
- Edge AI deployments

### Month 4 – MLOps & CI/CD
- GitHub Actions / GitLab CI for ML pipelines
- MLflow experiment tracking
- Airflow/Prefect for orchestration
- Cloud AI platforms (SageMaker, Vertex AI, Run.AI)

### Month 5 – Security, Compliance & Reliability
- CIS/NIST AI security practices
- Secrets management (Vault, KMS)
- Monitoring with Prometheus + Grafana
- Reliability & autoscaling

### Month 6 – Advanced Specialization & Capstone
- Advanced networking (RDMA, GPUDirect Storage)
- Exploring TPUs on Google Cloud
- **Capstone project**: End-to-end AI system (training → ONNX → TensorRT → Kubernetes → monitoring + CI/CD)
